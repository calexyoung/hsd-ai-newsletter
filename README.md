# 🌞 NASA Goddard Heliophysics Science Division  
## Weekly AI Newsletter  

Welcome to the repository for the **NASA Goddard Heliophysics Science Division (HSD) Weekly AI Newsletter**.  

This newsletter explores the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Generative AI (GenAI)** with **heliophysics research**. Our goal is to provide the HSD community with insights, updates, and practical tools for applying AI to space science and discovery.

## 🚀 Latest Issue  

### *Exploring AI, ML, and Generative Technologies in Heliophysics*  

- **Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs**  
- **Highlights from August 28, 2025**  
  - Featured talk: *Introduction to Surya: A Foundation Model in Heliophysics*  
  - Presenters: Andrés Muñoz-Jaramillo (SwRI), Madhulika Guhathakurta (NASA HQ), Daniel da Silva (UMBC/671), and the Surya team  
  - [📄 Surya Model Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14112)  
  - [💻 Surya on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/nasa-ibm-ai4science)  
  - [📂 Surya GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/Surya)  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Surya is a NASA-funded spatiotemporal transformer trained on nearly a decade of SDO imagery. It demonstrates strong performance in solar forecasting, segmentation, and space weather defense, setting a template for future scientific foundation models.

## ⚠️ Notes & Best Practices  

- **Always verify outputs** – LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect answers.  
- **Protect sensitive data** – Avoid uploading proprietary or restricted datasets to public tools.  
- **Expect variability** – Model outputs can differ across runs; log prompts and versions.
