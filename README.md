## Weekly AI Newsletter  

Welcome to the repository for the **NASA Goddard Heliophysics Science Division (HSD) Weekly AI Newsletter**.  

This newsletter explores the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Generative AI (GenAI)** with **heliophysics research**. Our goal is to provide the HSD community with insights, updates, and practical tools for applying AI to space science and discovery.

### *Exploring AI, ML, and Generative Technologies in Heliophysics*  

- **Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs**  
- **Highlights from September 25, 2025**  

This week’s edition brings practical tools and timely updates:

🗓️ Events to Watch:
NASA’s AI Center of Excellence webinar returns October 8 (Teams link included)
NVIDIA GTC DC coming October 27–29—free for .gov attendees

📚 New Weekly Terms:
Includes Prompt Chaining, Grounding, Latent Space, and Instruction Following

📜 NASA AI Policy Now Live:
A new directive outlines responsible use of AI-generated media—labeling, watermarking, and using only approved tools are now required

💬 Tips & Tricks:
Try domain-specific roles, reuse your best prompts, and combine LLMs with coding tools

⚠️ Caution Corner:
Watch for formatting bugs, hallucinated facts, role confusion, and short memory in models

🧪 New Research Highlights (arXiv):
Federation of Agents – a fabric for distributed multi-agent AI collaboration
Embodied AI – the bridge from LLMs to physical systems
Agentic Metacognition – failure-aware agents that know when to hand off to a human

Key Takeaway:
AI is a team member, not a magic box. Whether you're using GPT-4 or Claude, the results improve dramatically when you treat your prompt like a brief to a collaborator—clear, scoped, and structured.
