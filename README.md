## Weekly AI Newsletter  

Welcome to the repository for the **NASA Goddard Heliophysics Science Division (HSD) Weekly AI Newsletter**.  

This newsletter explores the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Generative AI (GenAI)** with **heliophysics research**. Our goal is to provide the HSD community with insights, updates, and practical tools for applying AI to space science and discovery.

### *Exploring AI, ML, and Generative Technologies in Heliophysics*  

- **Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs**  
- **Highlights from September 17, 2025**  
🗣️ How to Talk to an AI

Want better results from ChatGSFC, Claude, or GPT-4? It's not magic—it's prompting. How you phrase your request dramatically impacts what you get back. Great prompts include not just the task, but who the model should act like, what the output should look like, and who it’s for. Add examples, tone, and even constraints like “focus on heliophysics only.” The more context you give, the more useful and tailored the response becomes. Treat it like briefing a teammate, not Googling a fact.

**Key Takeaway:**  
👉 Think: Role + Task + Data + Format + Tone = Success
