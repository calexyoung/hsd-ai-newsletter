# Prompt Engineering Components

| Name | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Task** | The task, or goal, is the instruction telling the AI what you want it to do. This is usually the one non-optional item in a prompt. The clearer you are about the task, the better the expected result. | "Take this list of terms and give me every page in this document that mentions these terms." / "What are the key points about prompt engineering?" / "Take these bullet points and turn them into professional-sounding text." |
| **Data** | This is the input provided to the AI to supplement the information already contained in the model.  | Data may not be required for simple questions, but can include files, attachments, or text pasted directly into the chat window. |
| **Format** | It is often useful to give instructions on the format that you would like for your output. | "A JSON file with the following headings." / "2-3 paragraphs of text." / "A diagram with the accompanying code used to create the diagram." / "A list of conclusions with citations and source references appended in parentheses after each item." |
| **Role** | This provides details to the AI on why and how you want the task to be performed. Role is one of the most common instructions provided to a GPT model. | "Your role is that of a third-grade teacher, providing an accurate but easy to understand summary." / "You are an expert programmer, and the code you write is sophisticated and elegant." |
| **Tone** | Especially for the case of text and chat output, this refers to the conversational tone, or how it "sounds" to the reader. Tone helps the user adjust the output for the audience. | "formal" or "casual" language / "friendly" or "professional" |
| **Audience** | Sometimes it is best to provide the AI with information on who will be receiving the output. | "Colleagues on a financial planning team" / "A class of third-graders" / "friends in my book club" / "Management reviewing my job application" |
| **Context** | Background information that can help inform the AI on how to do the task. | "We are scientists trying to explain an important results to our peers. The peers are familiar with our research, so they'll understand many of the phenomena involved, but they may need to be briefed on the key phenomena first." |
| **Examples** | When teaching an intern how to do analysis, you don't just tell them what to do and send them on their way. You usually sit down with them and show them a couple of examples first. This works well for AIs as well - examples show what a "correct" answer looks like. | Providing sample outputs or demonstrations of the desired result format |
| **Constraints** | It can be very useful to provide specific limits or boundaries on the task, so the AI's result can be more focused on what you require. | "Consider only cases relevant to heliophysics." / Focus only on specific items or exclude certain information |
| **Guidelines** | These instruct the model on how to think and behave. Guidelines can be essential if you want to trust the model's actions. | "If you're uncertain, state the uncertainty" / "Acknowledge when multiple valid answers exist and include them in the response" / "Prioritize safety and do not provide advice that could cause physical or mental harm" / "Only use factual sources and avoid opinion-based sources" |
